# 1. Sort a Dictionary by Value
# Write a Python script to sort (ascending and descending) a dictionary by value.



# 2. Add a Key to a Dictionary
# Write a Python script to add a key to a dictionary.

# Students = {
#     "Alice": 85,
#     "Bob": 78,
#     "Charlie": 90,
#     "David": 62,
#     "Eve": 45
# }

# Students['Bekzod'] = 100
# print(Students)

# 3. Concatenate Multiple Dictionaries
# Write a Python script to concatenate the following dictionaries to create a new one.

# dic1 = {1: 10, 2: 20}
# dic2 = {3: 30, 4: 40}
# dic3 = {5: 50, 6: 60}
# dic4 = {}
# dic4.update(dic1)
# dic4.update(dic2)
# dic4.update(dic3)
# print(dic4)


# 4. Generate a Dictionary with Squares
# Write a Python script to generate and print a dictionary that contains a number (between 1 and n) in the form (x, x*x).

# numbers = list(range(1,5))
# new_dict = {number:number**2 for number in numbers}
# print(new_dict)

# 5. Dictionary of Squares (1 to 15)
# Write a Python script to print a dictionary where the keys are numbers between 1 and 15 (both included) and the values are the square of the keys.

# numbers = list(range(1,16))
# new_dict = {number:number**2 for number in numbers}
# print(new_dict)

# Set Exercises
# 1. Create a Set
# Write a Python program to create a set.

# nums = set(range(5, 50, 3))
# print(nums)

# 2. Iterate Over a Set
# Write a Python program to iterate over sets.

# nums = set(range(5, 50, 3))

# for num in nums:
#     print(num)


# 3. Add Member(s) to a Set
# Write a Python program to add member(s) to a set.

# nums = set(range(5, 50, 3))
# nums.add(51)

# 4. Remove Item(s) from a Set
# Write a Python program to remove item(s) from a given set.

nums = set(range(5, 50, 3))



# 5. Remove an Item if Present in the Set
# Write a Python program to remove an item from a set if it is present in the set.
